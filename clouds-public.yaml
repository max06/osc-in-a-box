# You can add multiple cloud configurations here and enable them by setting an
# Environment variable called `OS_CLOUD` - which is by default set to `mycloud`
#
# If you have more than one cloud account, add the cloud entry to the clouds
# section of your existing file and you can refer to them by name with
# OS_CLOUD=foo or --os-cloud=foo
